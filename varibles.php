<h3 class="pt-3 text-info">Variables:</h3>
<p>Variables are used to store information to be referenced and manipulated in a computer program. It is helpful to think of variables as containers that hold information. Their sole purpose is to label and store data in memory.</p>

<p>Variables are the names you give to computer memory locations which are used to store values in a computer program.</p>
<p>
	A variable is a way of referring to a storage area in a computer program. This memory location holds valuesâ€”numbers, text or more complicated types of data like payroll records.

Operating systems load programs into different parts of the computer's memory so there is no way of knowing exactly which memory location holds a particular variable before the program is run. When a variable is assigned a symbolic name like "employee_payroll_id," the compiler or interpreter can work out where to store the variable in memory.
</p>
<p>They are called variables because the represented information can change</p>
<p>Every variable has a name, called the variable name, and a data type. </p>
<p>The opposite of a variable is a constant. Constants are values that never change.</p>
